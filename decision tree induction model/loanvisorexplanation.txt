---LoanAdvisor/ Data Mining Model for Predicting Loan Default---

This guide explains how loanvisor.py file (in the decision tree induction model folder) is expected to be executed: decision tree induction model/loanvisor.py

1. The dataset can be downloaded from the link provided.

 
2. loanvisor.py is created in Spyder Python interpreter, but can be executed in any python interpreter.
   It is a procedural code. This implies that it is to be executed line-by-line because of the sequential dependencies of the codes.
   Chunks of lines of code are delineated by the comments can be run collectively.

   If the code is to be run in a Jupyter notebook, each chunk of code, separated by the comments, could be in each cell of the Jupyter notebook.

3. The dataset used in this study, SBAnational.csv, must be in the same directory as the loanvisor.py, or appropriate path (to be) specified in the python script.
