---LoanAdvisor/ Data Mining Model for Predicting Loan Default---

This guide explains how loandefault.py file (in the decision tree induction model folder) is expected to be executed.

1. The dataset can be downloaded from the link provided in the loandefault.py script.
 
2. loandefault.py is created in Spyder Python interpreter, but can be executed in any python interpreter.
   It is a procedural code. This implies that it is to be executed line-by-line because of the sequential dependencies of the codes.
   Chunk of code delineated by the comments can be run collectively.
   If the code is to be run in a Jupyter notebook, each chunk of code, separated by the comments, could be in each cell of the Jupyter notebook.

3. The dataset used in this study, SBAnational.csv, must be in the same directory as the loandefault.py, or appropriate path is specified in line 15 of the python script.


3. The webapp folder contains html, css and JavaScript files, and a model.py file.

4. All the contents of the webapp are expected to be in the sme folder to accurate rendering of the the pages.

5. This is still work in progress: The future plan is to have the prediction model, after being thouroughly finetuned, deployed in the cloud, like AWS EC2 instance
   and have a real feel of having predictive model in the production codebase.
