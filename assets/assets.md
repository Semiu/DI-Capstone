### (a) Cleaned data and (b) the Stratified data for the machine learning modeling 

The assets (as highlighted above) achieved from the [data merging](https://github.com/Semiu/DI-Capstone/blob/main/Proposal/1-data-cleaning-EDA/datamerging.ipynb) and [cleansing](https://github.com/Semiu/DI-Capstone/blob/main/Proposal/1-data-cleaning-EDA/datacleansing.ipynb) of the [downloaded data](http://web.archive.org/web/20140706042617/https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action), and the [stratified data](https://github.com/Semiu/DI-Capstone/blob/main/Proposal/1-data-cleaning-EDA/eda-cv.ipynb) (the data where the stratified kfold 
column has been added) are saved in Google Drive for accessibility.

Both can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iW8u-tqq_xtT8sNF4_xn_UXIU0Wj29cR?usp=sharing). 

The cleaned data is `treatedLCloandata.csv` and the stratified data is `stratifiedLCloandata.csv`.
