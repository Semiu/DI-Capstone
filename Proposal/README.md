### Capstone Project Proposal - A partial requirement for the Data Incubator's Spring 2022 Fellowship application

Lender, a machine learning-based peer-to-peer lending decision support application. 

It leverages both the predictive and prescriptive strengths of machine learning models to classify loan applications as safe or unsafe and prescribe what can be done for an unsafe application to be classified safe in future re-application. 

The application would reduce human error and bias in the underwriting process, save time and money, and improve the processâ€™s integrity. 

Safe applications have a higher probability (above a particular threshold) of repayment success, while unsafe applications have a lower probability (below a particular threshold) of repayment success.

Currently, the preliminary work done for the proposal stage is arranged in two (2) folders, numbered in order.

`1-data-cleaning-EDA` folder contains notebooks that performed data merging, different data cleaning processes, and the exploratory data analysis (EDA). The `datamerging` notebook contains scripts for the merging of the dataset, while the `datacleansing` notebook contains scripts for the data cleansing. Lastly, the `eda-cv` notebook contains script for the EDA and cross-validation data generation.

`2-basic-model` folder contains Python scripts for the models of the project. A logisitic regression model is developed by the script in `log_regression.py` file, and the XGboost model is developed with the script in `xgboost.py` file.

The Area Under Curve values for the Logistic Regression and XGBoost models are 0.9999999999415422 and 0.9999973618952145, respectively.

The `pitch-deck-DI` file is my single page pitch silde for the finalists' interview presentation.
